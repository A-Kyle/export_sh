#   This shell script is meant to establish the environmental     #
#   variables associated with the runtime environment.            #
#   It sets paths to important directories (e.g., those           #
#   containing executable files and paths to output) and defines  #
#   commands specific to the way the executable files are run.    #
#                                                                 #

#   This script should be invoked prior to all executions of      #
#   HAFS components.                                              #
